  "quick_opinions": [
    "Fresno's defense is ahead of its offense; script needs tightening. The Bulldogs forced turnovers but struggled on early downs, creating too many third-and-longs that stalled drives.",
    "USC's defensive coordinator needs to vary coverages against tempo. LSU's offense ran the same inside-zone concept nine times in the second half, and USC's safety rotation never adapted.",
    "Texas's defensive line depth is deeper than advertised. The Longhorns rotated eight players and never lost containment on outside runs, even as Rice's offense tried to stretch the field horizontally.",
    "Kansas State's quarterback showed better pocket presence than last year, but the Wildcats still can't protect against edge pressure. Three of Oklahoma's five sacks came from defensive ends running untouched into the backfield.",
    "Arizona's two-minute drill execution faltered against Utah's aggressive blitzes. The Wildcats had a chance to ice the game late but took two offensive holding penalties that backed them out of field-goal range.",
    "Utah's comeback was impressive, but relying on the quarterback as the primary runner is unsustainable. The Utes need more from their tailback committee or their signal-caller won't last past October.",
    "Rice's explosive passing game kept the Owls competitive, but their red-zone efficiency (1-of-3) cost them a chance to pull the upset. They averaged 17.2 yards per completion but couldn't finish drives.",
    "Third-down conversion rates across the board are down this weekend, suggesting defensive coordinators are winning the early-season chess matches. Offenses need to re-establish the run to set up passing windows."
